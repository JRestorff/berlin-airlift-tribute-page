<h1 class="display" >The Berlin <span class="font-primary">Airlift</span></h1>
<p class="standfirst">The Berlin blockade was one of the first major international crises of the Cold War. From June 24, 1948 to May 12, 1949 the Soviet Union blocked the Western Allies' access to the sectors of Berlin under allied control. In response, the Western Allies organized the Berlin airlift to carry supplies to the people in West Berlin.</p>

<article >
    <p>Three years after Germany’s unconditional surrender on May 8, 1945 and the resulting occupation by the four victorious powers, Berlin experienced a crisis that from today’s perspective appears as the first great conflict of the Cold War. The Soviet blockade of West Berlin confronted the Western powers with virtually insoluble problems. While the causes of the blockade were varied, the immediate occasion was a currency reform.</p>
    <p>The Western powers announced the currency reform on June 18 and it was implemented two days later. As an immediate response, the Soviet military administration interrupted passenger traffic to and from Berlin on June 19 in order to protect itself against the expected flood of now worthless Reichsmarks. Only the air corridors on which the four victorious powers had agreed in the Air Agreement of 1945/46 were unaffected. For that reason the three Western powers began an Airlift to Berlin to supply the city and its approximately two million inhabitants with the necessities. It lasted from June 26, 1948 to May 12, 1949. </p>
    <p>During that time Pilot Gail Halvorsen founded „Operation Little Vittles“, an effort to raise morale in Berlin by dropping candy via miniature parachutes to the city's residents.</p>
    <p>In June 2019, about 40 historic „Raisin Bombers“ returned for the 70th anniversary of the Airlift. At the airports in Wiesbaden-Erbenheim, Faßberg and Berlin/Schönhagen, crews and machines were at display to the public. It became an „air bridge to touch.“ <br>

    <h2>„Raisin Bombers”</h2>
    <p>„Raisin Bombers” (German: „Rosinenbomber”) or „Candy Bombers“ were colloquial terms Berliners gave to the Western Allied transport aircraft which brought in supplies by airlift to West Berlin during the Soviet Berlin Blockade. The name came from the fact that some pilots started to voluntarily throw sweets and candy (and, presumably, also raisins) on little tinkered parachutes out of the window to children lined up on the edges of the West Berlin airfields watching the planes. These actions were first attributed to American pilot Gail Halvorsen, nicknamed „Uncle Wiggly Wings“, who began to drop chocolate bars he had attached handkerchiefs to while approaching Tempelhof Airport. Today the name “Rosinenbomber” is commonly applied to several historic types of military aircraft involved in the Berlin Airlift.</p>

        Most U.S. planes used the southern corridor, which connected Frankfurt and Tempelhof, the U.S.-operated base in the heart of the city. All British planes and about 40 U.S. planes used the northern corridor, running southeast from the Hamburg area and landing at the British-operated Gatow airfield in West Berlin. Planes flew 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and would land as often as every minute.

            <div class="standfirst">The absolute highpoint of the entire Airlift was achieved in the so-called Easter Parade on April 16, 1949: On 1,398 flights, more than 12,940 ST (short tons) were flown to Berlin within 24 hours, so that on average an airplane loaded with supplies landed every 62 seconds.</div>
            <div class="popup__text">
            <p>The Easter Parade that took place on April 16, 1949 required near perfect teamwork. Fuel and bulk cargo were first loaded onto ships in the United States, sent across the Atlantic, and unloaded in Germany. Once there, the fuel and cargo were shipped to one of our U.S. Air Force airfields: two were in the American Zone and two in the British Zone. Freight from the American Zone went to Tempelhof Airfield and cargo from the British Zone went to Gatow Airport.</p>
            <p>Soviet forces harassed but did not attack the cargo aircraft of the Anglo-American alliance, although fighter pilots and antiaircraft gunners occasionally opened fire near the corridors, and searchlights that might temporarily blind a pilot sometimes played upon the aircraft by night. By the spring of 1949, it was obvious these tactics of harassment had failed to deter the American and British airmen involved in the airlift of supplies to Berlin.</p>

            <div class="standfirst">US Air Force pilot Gail Halvorsen pioneered the idea of dropping candy bars and bubble gum with handmade miniature parachutes, which later became known as „Operation Little Vittles.“ It was in effect from September 22, 1948 to May 13, 1949. For the Berlin Airlift Anniversary, the 98-year-old so called „Candy Bomber” returned to Germany in 2019.</div>
            <div class="popup__text">
            <p>Lieutenant Halvorsen's role in the Berlin Airlift was to fly one of many C-54 cargo planes used to ferry supplies into the starving city. At Tempelhof he saw about 30 children lined up behind one of the barbed-wire fences. He went to meet them and noticed that the children had nothing. So he told them that the following day he would drop gum out of his plane. </p>
            <p>The accumulated candy was heavy, so in order to ensure the children were not hurt by the falling candy, Halvorsen made three parachutes out of handkerchiefs and tied them to the rations. In the morning when he and his crew made regular supply drops, they also dropped three boxes of candy attached to handkerchiefs. They made these drops at regular intervals. Support for this effort to provide the children of Berlin with chocolate and gum grew quickly. As news of “Operation Little Vittles” reached the United States, children and candymakers from all over the US began contributing candy.</p>

            <div class="popup__text">
            <p>The Berlin Airlift Monument (properly the “Monument for the Victims of the Airlift”) was erected in 1951; it was the first major monument in West Berlin after the war. Its design, created by the German architect Eduard Ludwig, features three arcs pointing west to symbolize the three air corridors that were the city's lifelines. As a result of this Berliners also call it the “Hungerkralle” (“hunger claw”) or “Hungerharke” (“hunger rake”). An identical counterpart reaching towards Berlin was erected in 1985 by the German-American Airlift Association at Frankfurt Airport. Since 1988, a smaller copy has also stood at Celle Air Base in Lower Saxony.</p>
            <p>Eduard Ludwig (1906–1960) was a student at the Bauhaus design school, became one of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's favourite students, and after graduating worked for him in Berlin until 1937. After the war, in 1946, he became professor at the newly founded architecture school at the Hochschule für bildende Künste in Berlin, while maintaining his own architecture firm. He died in an accident in a bright red sports car on the AVUS, at the age of 54.</p>
